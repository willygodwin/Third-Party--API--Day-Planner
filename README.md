# Third-Party-API-Day-Planner

Create a simple calendar application that utilises third party API's
During this task we were required to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the working day.This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

During the development of this application we used a third party API (Moment.js) to retrieve the necessary time elements including current time, current day of the week and current date.
